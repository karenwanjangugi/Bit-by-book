        <div class="blog-text">

            <span id="blog-excerpt">"We tell people to follow their dreams, no matter what. I say chase your dreams, but
                be realistic. Understand that sometimes your dream isn't going to happen. You have to be willing to let
                it go. But I think if you aim for the stars, youâ€™ll land on the moon."</span>
            <br><br>
            This seemingly simple piece of advice, tucked within the pages of "Born a Crime," hints at a profound truth
            that manifests in his extraordinary life story. Trevor's ability to find humor in the face of absurdity,
            danger, and injustice wasn't just a coping mechanism, it was a vital form of armor.
            <br><br> Growing up mixed-race in apartheid South Africa, a world designed to categorize and oppress, Noah
            navigated the betrayous social landscapes with a wit so sharp it could disarm prejudice, if only for a
            moment. His narrative isn't just a recounting of hardship; it's a testament to the resilience of the human
            spirit, fueled by the unexpected power of laughter.
            <br><br>
            <h4>The Absurdity of Identity: Finding the Joke in Being <span id="blog-excerpt">"Colored"</span></h4>
            One of the most striking ways Noah wielded his humor as armor was in navigating his ambiguous racial
            identity. Classified as "colored" under apartheid, he belonged to a category that was neither Black nor
            White, existing in a limited space full of contradictions. He recounts numerous instances where this
            in-betweenness, while often confusing and sometimes dangerous, also presented opportunities for comedic
            observation.
            For example, his description of his mother's elaborate and often hilarious attempts to evade the authorities
            and the absurd rules surrounding his existence is portrayed with humor. He found humor in the ridiculousness
            of a system that tried so desperately to categorize people by boxing them illogically. <br><br>
            <span id="blog-excerpt">"Chinese people were classified as black and treated as second-citizens, while
                Japanese people were classified as white so the South Afrikan government could enjoy all the privileges
                given by the Japanese government at the time. It wasn't about color or biology-it was about power and
                money"</span>
            <br><br>Here, Trevor jokes about how crazy it was that two groups of East Asians could be treated
            differently because of poilitics. <span id="blog-excerpt">Politics is for sure a dirty game!</span>
            <h4>Language as a Weapon and a Shield: The Power of a Well-Timed Joke</h4>
            <div class="trevor">
                <img src="jennifer-images/trevor-noah.webp" alt="">
            </div>
            Noah's linguistic agility was not just a skill but a crucial tool for survival, often deployed with comic.
            His ability to speak multiple languages like Xhosa,his mother-tongue language, Zulu and Tswana allowed him
            to connect with different groups and avoid potentially hostile situations that came his way.
            Consider the anecdote where he narrowly escapes a beating by speaking Zulu to a group of intimidating men.
            The shock and subsequent laughter his linguistic prowess elicited transformed a dangerous encounter into a
            moment of shared humanity and connection with the Zulu strangers. In this instance, humor, delivered through
            language, acted as a shield, deflecting aggression and building bridges where there were none.
            <br><br> <span id="blog-excerpt">"I became a chameleon. My color didn't change, but i could change your
                perception about my color. I could walk through any group and say, 'What's Up my friend?' in Zulu, and
                they'd be like, "This little colored kid is cool. He's one of us' I could speak to Indian kids in
                Gujarati, to white kids in English, to colored kids in Afrikaans. I learned the quickest way to bridge
                the gap between people is through language."</span>
            <br><br>

            <h4>Childhood Mischief as a Form of Rebellion: Being Light-hearted in Restrictions</h4>

            Even in his childhood exploit, Trevor's portrays humor against the restrictive environment he grew up in.
            His mischievous adventures with his friend Teddy, often bordering on the absurd things like stealing from a
            mall a couple of times and ending up being chased for miles by the police , highlights a youthful spirit
            that refused to be fully constrained by the oppressive realities around them.
            Think about the story of him accidentally setting the white neighborhood on fire with his childhood friends.
            While the consequences were serious, the recalling of the event is filled with a youthful kind of humor that
            underscores the absurdity i see in the situation. This humor doesn't diminish the gravity of the incident
            but rather offers a lens through which to view the innate inequalities and the small acts of unintentional
            rebellion especially in someone's childhood.

            <br><br><span id="blog-excerpt">"We tell ourselves we feel bad about it but it is not true. We feel bad
                because we got caught. We feel bad because it might hurt our reputation.We dont actually feel bad about
                the thing we did. Regret is just a waste of time. Failure has answer but regret never does. We can only
                learn from it and move on.</span>

            </div>
            <h4>The Humor of Observation: Finding a Funny in Everyday Life</h4>
            Beyond the dangerous situations Noah faces, His humor still manages to shine through in his daily
            observations in South Africa particularly Soweto, his neighborhood. He finds things that are funny in
            cultural differences, family dynamics (particularly his relationship with his strict mother).
            His stories about his mother's strict discipline especially when insisting on regular church attendance that
            he wasn't comfortable with, Patricia's (Trevor's mom) unconventional methods of raising him are filled with
            warmth and humor.

            <h4>In conclusion</h4>
            Trevor Noah's "Born a Crime" is more than just a memoir; it's a great novel in using humor not as an escape
            from reality, but as a way to navigate and even challenge it. His laughter, born from the pain of his early
            life, became his armor, allowing him to connect with others, decrease tension, and ultimately, to tell his
            remarkable story with an evoking voice that is both sad and funny. His journey reminds us that even in the
            darkest of times, the ability to laugh can be a powerful testament to the enduring strength of our human
            spirit.
