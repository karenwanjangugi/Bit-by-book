        <div class="blog-text">
            <h3>Born a Crime</h3>
            <img src="jennifer-images/book.jpg" alt="">
            <span id="blog-excerpt">"I was born a crime. When you tell people you were born a crime, they think you are
                exaggerating, but it's true. My existence was illegal. My mother was black and my father was white, and
                South Africa's immorality Act made it illegal for them to have children together. If the police had
                caught my mother and father together, they would go to jail"</span>
            <br>
            Trevor's "Born a Crime"- a title as stark and impactful as the realities it unveils. But what if we looked
            at his journey with a different lens? Since I have been given the honor of bestowing a new title to this
            great memoir, I propose : <h3>"Mama Said"</h3>
            <img src="jennifer-images/mama.jpg" alt="">
            <br>
            join me as I explore why this alternative title resonates well with and reflects the enduring power of the
            original.

            <br><br><span id="blog-excerpt">"My mother raised me as if there were no limitations on where I could go o
                what I could do. When I look back I realize she raised me like a white kid not intentionally, but just
                by teaching me thoughts and feelings mattered, that I deserved to be heard"</span><br><br>
            The excerpt above beautifully captures the unwavering belief and guidance of Trevor Noah's mother, Patricia
            Nombuyiselo. Her voice, her lessons and her strong spirit are a constant guide throughout "Born a Crime"
            Trevor once said that the first thign his mom taught him was to think for himself and that is why he
            questions everything. Isn't that just so evident? Trevor questions the illogicality of the political system,
            He questions the concept of Christianity, relationships, racism and apartheid. Trevor questions everything!
            This shows the powering force that his mother had in shaping his destiny.

            Reading Noah's memoir, I am struck by the constant presence and wisdom of his mother. Her voice echoes
            through his sad and humorous experiences guiding him in understanding the complex world he lives in. His
            mother teaches him a lot about self-freedom which has made Trevor what he is today, through stand-up comedy
            and daily TV shows he gets to connect and share with the world on a personal level without fear of judgement
            or insecurity.
            <h4>The Paradox of Possession: Reflective Blog</h4>
            <span id="blog-excerpt">"Abel wanted a traditional marriage with a traditional wife, but he never fell in
                love with subservient women. He only wanted a woman who is free because his dream was to put her in a
                cage"</span>
            This quote is unsettling to one's heart especially that of a woman. It is depicted in Trevor's "Born a
            Crime" through the complex and ultimately abusive love relationship between his mother, Patricia, and his
            stepfather, Abel. Their love lies in a confusing paradox with the desire for independence but also the urge
            to control it. Reflecting on this reveals uncomfortable truths about power, insecurity and the confusing
            ways in which love can manifest.
            <h4>Resonance with modern society</h4>
            <h5>The illusion of the "Strong, Independent Partner</h5>
            Even today, there usually is an initial attraction to a partner perceived as strong, independent and
            "free-minded". However, this admiration mostly masks an underlying insecurity or a desire to ultimately
            control that very independence you were once attracted to.
            I once had neighbors, who were super devoted to family but couldn't just stand having both of them being
            breadwinners.
            <br>The modern relationship within today's societal expectations lean towards egalitarianism where partners
            are seen more as equals and mutual respect for one's independence is encouraged.

            <h5>The Persistence of Traditional Gender Roles</h5>
            while societal expectations are evolving, the desire for a "traditional marriage with a traditional wife"
            still exists for some. This often entails expectations of women agreeing on their male partner's proposals
            abd prioritizing domestic duties more than their own fulfillment. Abel's desire to cage Patricia from her
            goal for Trevor to connect with his father aligns with this traditional approach. However, today's society
            has a lot of emphases on individual autonomy. The idea of "caging" a partner literally or metaphorically, is
            strongly discouraged by most law and education systems adopted by the Western culture. I see it as more of
            an unethical and inhumane act. What kind of love is that that makes you want to cage and control someone? I
            believe love should be putting one another's needs and goal first even if it means letting them go for them
            to accomplish such.
            <h5>Conclusion</h5>
            While according to me, the context of apartheid in South Africa adds layers to Abel's character and the
            societal norms he might have internalized, the paradox of desiring freedom in a partner only to want to
            control still resonates with us to some extent even to date. However, modern society is increasingly moving
            towards relationship models that value equality, freedom and respect.
