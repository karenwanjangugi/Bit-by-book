                <p id="excerpt">"When it was time to pick my name, she chose Trevor, a name with no meaning whatsoever
                    in
                    South Africa, no precedent in my family. <br>
                    It's not even a Biblical name. It's just a name. My mother wanted her child beholden to no fate. She
                    wanted me to be free to go anywhere, do anything, be anyone."</p>
                <p>
                    Patricia Nombuyiselo Noah, is a fearless, devout and nonetheless independent woman who
                    single-handedly
                    mothered Trevor Noah eversince he was a small kid. Patricia was the middle child to Tempererance and
                    frances Noah, who despite being her parents, never looked out for her as they sent her to their
                    Xhosa
                    homeland as a teenager where she worked on the family farm and starved. This formed her resilient
                    character and her survival skills which would help her navigate her adult life as the mother to
                    Trevor.
                    <br><br>

                    Patricia was devoted to showing Trevor that every opportunity is accessible to anyone, especially
                    someone from their class and race.She managed to protect Trevor by hiding him inside and at times
                    pretending that she is her maid to avoid being seen together in public, this was majorly because she
                    loved him and would not afford to lose him to the law. Patricia dedicated herself to teaching Trevor
                    English, as his first language and exposing him to so much information involving his role as a man
                    and
                    relationships. This would mould Trevorâ€™s confidence and push him to become the famous personality he
                    is
                    today.<br><br>

                    Patricia, was also very keen with Trevorâ€™s discipline offering beatings, whenever necessary. This
                    was to
                    imply that the society is ruthless to a man of color and unless he stands up for himself he would
                    live
                    to be suppressed for the rest of his days.She was, however, very protective of Trevor whenever he
                    was in
                    trouble. She defended him in school when he got into trouble and never held back from defending
                    Trevor
                    against Abel.<br><br>


                </p>

                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>
                    Patricia as implied in the book was basically Trevorâ€™s greatest inspiration ðŸ˜€. It is quite clear
                    that
                    Patricia was Trevorâ€™s greatest hero and without her he would not push through his life as a man of
                    colour.
